### Component Architecture

ForkLoop leverages modular React components for recipe discovery and meal planning:

**Core Components:**
- `RecipeCard` - Individual recipe display and interaction
- `RecipeDetail` - Comprehensive recipe view with ingredients/instructions  
- `SearchFilters` - Dietary preferences, cuisine, cooking time filters
- `RecipeCollection` - Personal saved recipes and meal plans
- `UserProfile` - Dietary preferences and cooking skill management

**Utility Structure:**
```

â”œâ”€â”€ components/           # React components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App/             # Main application logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ RecipeCard/      # Recipe display components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Header/          # Navigation and branding
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Profile/         # User management
â”œâ”€â”€ contexts/            # React context providers
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/               # API utilities (Spoonacular, auth)
â”œâ”€â”€ images/              # Assets and icons
â””â”€â”€ vendor/              # Third-party resources

### Add Reference to terminal - add to .bashrc, .zshrc etc

open a terminal and copy below and paste the following

```
  export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
  [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
  [ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
```

open a new terminal || type `source ~/.bashrc || ~/.zshrc .. etc`

### Install npm with nvm plugin

- open a new terminal

check installed nvm version

- type : `nvm -ls`

### If nvm version not installed

- type : `nvm install <node version>`

then

- type : `nvm use`

### Install project packages

- type : `npm i || npm install`

## Run Commands

`npm run nvmSelect` - Selects nvm version and runs

`npm run build` - Build Production (Vite + React)

`npm run clean` - Removes build artifacts '/node_modules' && '/build'

`npm run start` - starts React App Interface

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser

### Setup Spoonacular API

1. Create account at [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api)
2. Get your API key (150 requests/day free tier)
3. Add API key to environment configuration

### Development Server (Optional)

For local development with mock data:
`npm install -g json-server@^0`

- copy 'mockdb/mockdb.json' to root as `db.json`
- run: `json-server --watch db.json --id \_id --port 3001`
